-- and 'preserveInput'.  The exceptions are complex to real and half-complex to
-- real transforms.
nullFlag :: Flag

-- Algorithm restriction flags
--

-- | Allows FFTW to overwrite the input array with arbitrary data; this can
-- sometimes allow more efficient algorithms to be employed.
--
-- Setting this flag implies that two memory allocations will be done, one for
-- work space, and one for the result.  When 'estimate' is not set, we will be
-- doing two memory allocations anyway, so we set this flag as well (since we
-- don't retain the work array anyway).
destroyInput :: Flag

-- | 'preserveInput' specifies that an out-of-place transform must not change
-- its input array. This is ordinarily the default, except for complex to real
-- transforms for which 'destroyInput' is the default. In the latter cases,
-- passing 'preserveInput' will attempt to use algorithms that do not destroy
-- the input, at the expense of worse performance; for multi-dimensional complex
-- to real transforms, however, no input-preserving algorithms are implemented
-- so the Haskell bindings will set 'destroyInput' and do a transform with two
-- memory allocations.

-- | Instruct FFTW not to generate a plan which uses SIMD instructions, even if
-- the memory you are planning with is aligned.  This should only be needed if

-- may be unaligned (i.e. you constructed the 'CArray' with
-- 'unsafeForeignPtrToCArray').

-- | 'estimate' specifies that, instead of actual measurements of different
-- algorithms, a simple heuristic is used to pick a (probably sub-optimal) plan
-- quickly. With this flag, the input/output arrays are not overwritten during
-- planning.
--
-- This is the only planner flag for which a single memory allocation is possible.
estimate :: Flag
estimate = Flag c_estimate

-- | 'measure' tells FFTW to find an optimized plan by actually computing
-- several FFTs and measuring their execution time. Depending on your machine,
-- this can take some time (often a few seconds). 'measure' is the default
-- planning option.
measure :: Flag
measure = Flag c_measure

-- | 'patient' is like 'measure', but considers a wider range of algorithms and
-- often produces a "more optimal" plan (especially for large transforms), but
-- at the expense of several times longer planning time (especially for large
-- transforms).
patient :: Flag

-- | 'exhaustive' is like 'patient' but considers an even wider range of
-- algorithms, including many that we think are unlikely to be fast, to
-- produce the most optimal plan but with a substantially increased planning
-- time.
